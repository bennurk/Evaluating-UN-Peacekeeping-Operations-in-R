# Evaluating UN Peacekeeping Operations in R

Peacekeeping by the United Nations is a unique and dynamic role held by the Department of
Peace Operations to provide security and the political and peacebuilding support to countries.
The interventions are aimed to reduce hostility between the conflicting parties and also create
fruitful grounds for a sustainable peace process in the conflict area. In recent years, it has

battlefield, this demand may be warranted. In this data article, an argument is tested claims
that the effect of the UN troops size on reducing the battle-related fatalities is stronger once a
ceasefire agreement is in place.
